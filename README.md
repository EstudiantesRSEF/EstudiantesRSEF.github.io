## Contributing

Please read our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before submitting pull requests.

## Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning in this fashion:

  * Major version numbers X change incrementally whenever significant change to the website code is being introduced. For example, a large or potentially backward-incompatible change to the base code. These should always be developed in separated Git branches and never be merged except a global consensus by the Executive Committee is reached.

  * Common version numbers Y change incrementally whenever a new, minor feature is introduced, new content is released or when a set of smaller features is rolled out. These should be introduced using Pull Requests. These could be hold for a limited time in order to verify its integrity and mergeability.

  * Minor version numbers Z change incrementally whenever a critical or non-critical reversable patch or bug-fix is required. These are issued via Pull Requests and accepted as soon as possible in order to stabilize each Y version.

## File Naming Convention

It is in our best practice to use the most simple syntax possible for any file while preserving the name and structure of the contents in Castilian Spanish and American English. Use lower cases, delimit words by hyphens, not spaces. Dates are written in reverse manner always, followed by the file name as described: {YYYY-MM-DD}-{name-of-file}.{extension}.
