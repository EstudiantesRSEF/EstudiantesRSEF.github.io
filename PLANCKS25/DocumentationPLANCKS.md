1. Free Circulation of Scientists: The principle of the Universality of Science is fundamental to scientific progress. This 
principle embodies freedom of movement, association, expression and communication for scientists, as well as equitable
access to data, information and research materials. In pursuing its objectives with respect to the rights and responsibilities of
scientists, the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) actively upholds this principle, and, in so doing,
opposes any discrimination on the basis of such factors as ethnic origin, religion, citizenship, language, political stance,
gender, or age. IUPAP should only sponsor conferences and events at institutions and in countries that uphold this principle.
If scientists are excluded from attending IUPAP-sponsored international conferences by a host institution or country on the
basis of any of these factors, IUPAP should register its concern at the highest level of that institution or country, and should
not sponsor any future events in that country until such exclusions have been eliminated. 
[ Section 1. (<a href="http://iupap.org/sponsored-conferences/conference-policies/">http://iupap.org/sponsored-conferences/conference-policies/</a>)]

2. Harassment at Conferences: It is the policy of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) that all
participants at an IUPAP-supported Conference will enjoy a comfortable experience, and that they will treat each other with
respect at all times. The conference organisers will appoint two advisors at the conference who will consult with those who
have suffered from harassment and who will suggest ways of redressing their problems, and an advisor who will counsel
those accused of harassment.
