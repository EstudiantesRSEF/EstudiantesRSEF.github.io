      <h2>IUPAP Conference Policies</h2>
      
      <p>As PLANCKS 2025 follows the guidelines and principles established by the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP), we want to highlight two fundamental policies that shape our event's commitment to inclusivity and respect.</p>

      <h3><a href="http://iupap.org/sponsored-conferences/conference-policies/">1. Free Circulation of Scientists</a></h3>

      <p>The principle of the Universality of Science is fundamental to scientific progress. This principle embodies freedom of movement, association, expression and communication for scientists, as well as equitable access to data, information and research materials.</p>

      <p>In pursuing its objectives with respect to the rights and responsibilities of scientists, the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) actively upholds this principle, and, in so doing, opposes any discrimination on the basis of such factors as ethnic origin, religion, citizenship, language, political stance, gender, or age.</p>

      <p>IUPAP should only sponsor conferences and events at institutions and in countries that uphold this principle. If scientists are excluded from attending IUPAP-sponsored international conferences by a host institution or country on the basis of any of these factors, IUPAP should register its concern at the highest level of that institution or country, and should not sponsor any future events in that country until such exclusions have been eliminated.</p>

      <h3><a href="http://iupap.org/sponsored-conferences/conference-policies/">2. Harassment at Conferences</a></h3>

      <p>It is the policy of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) that all participants at an IUPAP-supported Conference will enjoy a comfortable experience, and that they will treat each other with respect at all times.</p>

      <p>The conference organisers will appoint two advisors at the conference who will consult with those who have suffered from harassment and who will suggest ways of redressing their problems, and an advisor who will counsel those accused of harassment.</p>
