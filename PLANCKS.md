   <p>
      PLANCKS is an annual international physics contest for bachelor and master students. Itâ€™s usually a three day event and can include in addition to the competition itself social events like a symposium, excursions, parties and the award ceremony. PLANCKS is arranged by different IAPS member committees.
        <br>
         Participants of PLANCKS compete in teams consisting of three to four members and they have to answer very difficult physics exercises. Some countries are currently organising a preliminary for PLANCKS and the winners of these preliminaries will participate in PLANCKS, in other countries people can show interest and the participants will be selected by a random number generator.
       <br>
          The intention of the competition is to increase international collaboration, social activities and personal development of individual contestants. By gathering physics students from different parts of the world, a setting to exchange ideas and experiences and to challenge each other is created.
